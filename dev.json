Traffic Control System USING ARDUINO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuration:4 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: Traffic congestion is a severe problem in most of the cities across the world and it has become a nightmare for the citizens. It is caused by delay in signal, inappropriate timing of traffic signalling etc. The delay of traffic light is hard coded and it does not depend on traffic. Therefore, for optimising traffic control, there is an increasing demand in systematic quick automatic system. This project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal control. The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. The microcontroller used in this project is ARDUINO. The system contains IR sensors & ultrasonic sensors (transmitter and receiver) which will be mounted on the either side of the road on poles.

As we are aware information or data is increasing at an amazing rate. In fact some industry expects that collected information sizes will probably double in size every two to three years. Basically data which is no longer needed by the application to address business functionality should be purged or archived. If data is required for record retention requirements, then it should be archived from the DBMS to an application controlled format. Keeping unneeded data online or in warehouses have costs associated with them which can directly affect our membership. Transactions can take longer to process, and use more CPU which also increases the cost of each transaction.
